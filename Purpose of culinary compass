The Culinary Compass web application has one main purpose: to empower users to cook more efficiently and creatively with the ingredients they already have.
It solves a common problem many people face: looking in their kitchen and not knowing what to make. Instead of requiring users to search for a recipe and then see if they have the ingredients, this app flips the process. You start with what you have, and the app tells you what you can create.
The app's goal is to help you:
Reduce food waste by prioritizing recipes that use ingredients you already own.
Save money by cutting down on unnecessary trips to the grocery store.
Simplify meal planning by providing an easy way to organize your weekly meals and generate a cohesive shopping list.
Inspire creativity in the kitchen by suggesting new recipes based on your existing pantry.
In short, the application acts as a personal kitchen assistant, transforming the way you think about meal preparation from a chore into a more resourceful and enjoyable experience.
